1 -> what is Data Structure?
-> Data can be arranged in many ways, logical or mathematical arrangements of data is called Data Structure
EX: Array, Linked List, Graphs , Queue, Tree Graph, and many more.

2 -> what is an Algorithms?
-> Sequence of steps performed on the data using efficient data structure to solve a given problem.
EX: Sorting an Array

3 -> classification of Data Structure
-> Data Structure-> Primitive (int, float , string) && Non-Primitive

->Non-Primitive-> linear && Non Linear
Non Linear -> Tree && Graph

->Linear ->Static(Array) && Dynamic(Linked List, Stack, Queue)

4 -> Types of Data Structures 
a-> Primitive and non-primitive
b-> Static and Dynamic Data structure
c-> Persistent and Ephoneral Data Structure
